# Enterprise Network Design, Security & High Availability Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-on enterprise network design simulating a real-world campus environment.
It focuses on routing, switching, security, redundancy, and core network services.

## Architecture
- Core–Distribution–Access model
- VLAN-based segmentation
- Redundant gateways and uplinks

## Technologies & Protocols
- Routing: OSPF, BGP
- Switching: VLANs, Trunking, STP/RSTP
- High Availability: HSRP, ECMP
- Security: ACLs, NAT, Cisco ASA, Palo Alto NGFW
- VPN: Site-to-Site IPSec, Remote Access VPN
- Services: DHCP, DNS, NTP, AAA (RADIUS/TACACS+)
- QoS: Voice and Video traffic prioritization
- IP: IPv4 and IPv6

## Tools Used
- GNS3 / Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark
- Network Diagram Tools

## Key Outcomes
- Designed scalable and fault-tolerant network architecture
- Implemented secure traffic segmentation and redundancy
- Practiced troubleshooting and documentation

## Disclaimer
This is a hands-on academic and lab-based project created for learning and demonstration purposes.
